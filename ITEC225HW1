Hello, my name is Ana I'm a junior here at RU. My major is Graphic Design, with a minor in ITEC. I used to be a CS major but due to some
bad expiriences in my physics class, I discovered that CS was just not for me. However, during one of my CS classes, computer graphics, I 
was facinated when we got to make 3D objects I found that to be morem easy than programming. After that semmester, I told my consuler what I wanted,
I drop my CS major title and became a general studies major so I could eventually transfer to RU for graphic design. I love art, I find amazing that
art is not meant to be understood but appreciate, regards if you think is good or not. Personally my real dream is to be part of the video game industry
where was programming, design the graphics or just the merch. And thats what I hope I end uo doing.
